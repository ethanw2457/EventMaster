# EventMaster
Having both come from musical backgrounds, we both know the late nights, early mornings, and thousands of hours of frustration just to be able to perform in front of the communities that we love. But, often times our concerts, other art galleries, and heartfelt poems are attended by just family members. Local youth art is not getting the recognition it deserves and we hope to change it. From the elderly population to aspiring students, we know the community is interested in such artistic performances, but is often times unfortunately and innocently unaware that they are taking place. EventMaster aims to bring together a community of passion for art and recognize the hard and sincere work of our youth.

Using data visualization to show how various decisions, like mode of transportation, affect the environment, and providing workable solutions like carpooling apps and directories of environmentally conscious companies helps create a sustainable environment one step at a time. Through our Green Food Explorer clients are able to make a more informed decision on where they want to eat while also helping support green businesses. With GreenPool, locals from a community can take advantage of a trusted service to carpool with friends and family to mutual events. Green Assistant helps traveling groups make better decisions on where they want to go for vacation by telling them of the reputation of the company, the pollution costs, and more! These initiatives underscore a commitment to environmental stewardship and fostering a more sustainable future.
